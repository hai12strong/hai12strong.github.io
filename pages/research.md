#### <u>“Does spoofing erode market welfare?”</u>

*My job market paper, “Does spoofing erode market welfare?” (joint with prof. Bart Taub) explores spoofing from historical, economics and regulatory perspectives. Over the past decades, spoofing is the main target of regulators around the world.  Nearly 10% number of cases filed by CFTC in 2020 involved spoofing. In contrast, there is nearly no scholarly attention paid to spoofing in economic literature. Our paper is the first paper that provide a testable framework for spoofing. In the paper, we present a model of strategic interactions between a spoofer and an anticipatory trader who can observe the signal of the fundamental informed investor's order in the second period. Learning the anticipatory trading strategy,  the spoofer submits a spoofing order to mislead the anticipatory trader about the incoming order. The order anticipation HFT protects itself by reducing its market participation. A pure strategy spoofing equilibrium exists and both traders make positive profits. While spoofing delays price discovery in a short horizon, price divergence will be so brief as to have no little economic efficiency implications. Contrary to misgivings expressed by some regulators and market participants, spoofing improves market liquidity and fosters uninformed traders' welfare. By examining dozens of legal spoofing cases and its victims’ testimony, we pointed out that the main victims are HFTs that employ order anticipation strategies. .*

#### <u>“The value of information flows in the stock marke?”</u>

*The paper “The value of information flows in the stock marke?” (joint with prof. Bart Taub) contributes to the literature by introducing a new method to estimate thevalue of the information. By drawing an analogy between the price impact λ and the slope of the limit order book, our results confirm the validity of the Kyle [1985] model under the limit order book settings, which is under question as in the original paper, the market was modeledas a dealer market with only market orders.*

*Contrary to the traditional postulation of Kyle’s λ, which suggests its estimation is derived
from execution data, we propose a novel approach by positing that Kyle’s λ is expressed in the
order book. Additionally, we estimated price and volume volatilities through an entirely different
methodology by using execution orders. Although the price impact and volatility estimates are
carried out using entirely different data and methods, they confirm the predictions of the Kyle
model.*

*Our results support the notion that the cross-correlation of price impact across stocks is consistent with the CAPM: there is a single systematic component of price impact, and this is driven by the volatility of the systematic component of the stock market. This result suggests that by separating the underlying information into two components, systematic and idiosyncratic, informed traders distinguish between productive assets that have a systematic impact on the economy and those that can be diversified. .*

#### <u>“Arbitraging Nonlinear Price Impact: Testing Huberman and Stanzl”</u>

*This paper investigates the relationship between the cumulative size of liquidity and the price
impact of order book events by using trades and quotes data from 83 Nasdaq-listed stocks. We
propose the slope of the limit order book as a new measure of price impact. By analyzing both
bid and ask sides of high-frequency limit order book snapshot data, our study shows that there is
a linear relationship between the cumulative size of liquidity and price impact in the limit order
book. In addition, we find that if price impact admits a nonlinear functional form, under certain
circumstances, a profitable round-trip arbitrage exists. We empirically show the minimum required
trading volume for a profitable self-financing arbitrage and conditions that limit arbitrage.*
